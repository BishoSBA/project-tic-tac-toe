## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A tic-tac-toe game played in the browser built completely on the client-side.

## Optimizations

* Improve the UI
* Add the ability to change names of the players
* Add the option to choose which player to start
* Add gamemode against AI

## Lessons Learned:

* Using objects and classes to implement required game functionality
* Additional hands-on Javascript coding to improve my fluency in the language

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
